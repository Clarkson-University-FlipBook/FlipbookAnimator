Overview of the project

3 main components:
    1) drawing (Michael)
    2) saving/loading and rendering/exporting (Andres)
    3) playback (Will)
    4) GUI (Dalton)
    5) timeline (Giner)

- playback component should be able to play forwards and backwards
- playback should allow user to control speed of playback
- rendering/exporting should allow user to control speed of the animation
- rendering/exporting should allow user to choose between GIF and MP4 formats

- drawing is black/white/grey, with before- and after-frames having a colored tint and a lowered opacity (ex: before green and after blue)
- drawing should allow user to import a custom background image
    note: the program should be able to use a color background as long as the overlay function does not consider it (in other words, the overlay function only uses the user's drawings, not the background)
- saving/loading will create a zip file containing pngs of the user's drawings and an optional background
- the drawings should be stored in a vector of Image objects, which is kept in a class that interfaces with the rest of the program and enforces thread safety

Next Meeting: Friday at 4!
